``The most direct evidence for tensor correlations in nuclei comes from measurements of the deuteron structure functions and tensor polarization by elastic electron scattering~\cite{Gilman:2001yh}. In essence, these measurements have mapped out the Fourier transforms of the charge densitites of the deuteron in states with spin projections $\pm1$ and 0, showing that they are very different."~-R. Schiavilla, et al.~\cite{Schiavilla:2006xx}
