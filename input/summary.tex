\section{Summary}

The ratio of the S- and D-wave state of the deuteron is not well constrained by current wavefunction models, which is particularly important in describing tensor-related effects such as short range correlations. Measuring the tensor asymmetry $A_{zz}$ by electron scattering off of tensor polarized deuterons in the quasi-elastic region region provides necessary information for extracting this ratio. With \productiondays days of beam and an additional \overheaddays days of overhead, $A_{zz}$ can be measured at $Q^2=1.5$, $0.7$, and $0.3~(\mathrm{GeV}/c)^2$ in Hall C using identical equipment as the upcoming $b_1$ measurement while being less sensitive to systematic uncertainties. In addition, it will fill a gap in measurements of $A_{zz}$ between the $T_{20}\propto A_{zz}$ elastic measurements and the $b_1\propto \frac{A_{zz}}{F_1^d}$ deep-inelastic measurements.
