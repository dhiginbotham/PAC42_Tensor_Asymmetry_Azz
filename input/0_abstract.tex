The tensor-polarized target asymmetry, \Azz, which is used to extract $b_1$ in the DIS region through the D($e,e'$)X channel, can be used to extract information on nucleon-nucleon interactions in the quasi-elastic region. 

In the quasi-elastic region, \Azz was first calculated in 1988 by Frankfurt and Strikman, using the Hamada-Johnstone and Reid soft-core wave functions \cite{Frankfurt:1988nt}. Recent calculations by {M.~Sargsian} revisit \Azz in the $x>1$ range using virtual-nucleon and light-cone methods, which differ by up to a factor of two \cite{MISAK}.



An experimental determination between the two calculations could be performed utilizing the set-up available for E13-12-011 by adding a single kinematic setting.
